# Tricount Clone Work in progress
Clone of popular application Tricount. Implemented as console app using Java and
Cassandra as Database.

## How it works 
You as a user and group of friends make room where each of users can put their 
payment if they bought someone anything. App will calculate final debts and tell
users who have to return money to whom.It makes easier counting money on trips. 
Usually you have pay only one person instead of few in the end. 


## How it works in technical way
I think it will have to take all debts from data base everytime someone put new 
payment, next app calculate results and sends them to the database. 
Database will additionally store all payments if any use would want to 
change mistake.
